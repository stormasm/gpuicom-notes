```rust
   focus_handle: gpui::FocusHandle,
```

In user interface design, a handle is an indicator of a starting point for a drag and drop operation. Typically, when the pointer is placed on a handle, its shape changes to show an icon that represents the supported drag operation.

Handles are crucial for allowing users to manipulate elements within the interface, such as resizing windows or moving objects. They provide a clear visual cue for where the user can initiate a drag action, enhancing the usability and intuitiveness of the interface.
